## Features

- **User-Customizable Instructions:**
  - Users can upload their unique set of instructions, tailored to their specific requirements, without needing a computer connection.
  
- **Enhanced Capacity:**
  - Expanded the register bank and instruction memory to support a larger range of instructions and data.
  
- **Interactive Interface:**
  - Utilized an inbuilt Seven Segment display for improved user interaction and output display.
  
## Technologies

- VHDL

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/rewritable-nano-processor.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd rewritable-nano-processor`
3. Open the project in your preferred VHDL development environment.

## Usage

1. Customize instructions as per your requirements and save them.
2. Upload the customized instructions to the processor.
3. Run the processor to execute the uploaded instructions.

## Testing on Basys3 Board

To test the project using the Basys3 board, follow these steps:
1. Load the synthesized program onto the Basys3 board.
2. Use the set of switches on the Basys3 board to input instructions.
3. Run the processor to execute the instructions based on the switch settings.
